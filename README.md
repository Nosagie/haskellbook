Exercise solutions for _Haskell Programming from first principles_, a.k.a. [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com)

This is currently a pitiful mess. Most of it is my fault, but the book itself is also unfinished work, 
and the exercises are not always properly marked as such or mentioned in the _Answers_ section of each chapter.
Many exercises have no numeral identification.

I might start numbering chapters and exercises from now on, but I'm already towards the end of Chapter 11...
